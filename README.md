# C Programming Language

1. What is C programming language?  
   C is a high-level, block-based, structured, procedure-oriented programming language.
   
2. What is a header file? Give an example.  
   A header file is written in text format that contains function and macro declarations. These files have an extension of '.h'. e.g.- 'stdio.h'.  

3. What is a library file? Give an example.  
   A library file is written in binary format that contains function definitions. These files have an extension of '.dll'.

4. What are the different datatypes in C? Give examples.  
   There are 3 types of datatypes in C.  
   a. The pre-defined datatypes in the C programming language are known as Primitive datatypes. e.g.- char, int, float, double.  
   b. Datatypes that are derived from the primitive types are known as Non-Primitive datatypes. e.g.- array, pointer.  
   c. Datatypes that are defined by the user to store the data accordingly are known as User-defined datatypes. e.g.- structure, union, enum.  

5. What are the sizes of different primitive datatypes?  
   char (1 byte)  
   int (4 bytes)  
   float (8 bytes)  
   double (16 bytes)  

6. Float and double variable can store up to how much precision?  
   A float variable can store up to a precision of 6.  
   A double variable can store up to a precision of 15.

7. What are modifiers or qualifiers?  
   Modifiers or qualifiers are used to modify the size and range of the data that various data types can hold. It is primarily used to modify the size, and sign of the data.  
   There are 2 types of modifiers  
   a. Sign modifiers - signed, unsigned  
   b. Size modifiers - short, long

8. short modifier is applicable with which datatypes?  
   short modifier is only used with int datatype. A short int has a size of 2 bytes (half of the size of an int).  

9. long modifier is applicable with which datatypes?  
   long modifier is used with both int and double datatype. It doubles the size that a datatype can hold.
